# Tests

This project uses Node's built-in test runner and c8 for coverage.

## Quick run

- Lint & format check: `node --run lint`
- Spell checking: `node --run test:spelling`
- Unit tests: `node --run test:unit`
- Coverage: `node --run test:coverage`
- Watch mode (local dev): `node --run test:watch`

## Guidelines

- Keep tests side-effect free; mock/bypass filesystem, network, and timers where necessary.
- Focus on **critical logic with edge cases** (e.g., JSON parsing, backup rotation, class management).
- Avoid testing trivial mappings or 1-line forwarding logic.
- For API helpers in `API/api.js`, bind functions to a fake context rather than spinning an Express server.
- For `node_helper.js` paths, test logic by stubbing methods (e.g., `sendSocketNotification`, `sendResponse`) and, when necessary, mock timers.
- Follow repository lint rules; keep arrays/objects on one line where stylistic rules require it.

## Notes on shims used in tests

- We provide lightweight shims under `tests/shims/` (e.g., `logger.js`, `node_helper.js`) to isolate unit tests from MagicMirror core. When a test needs to load `node_helper.js`, inject the shim path via `NODE_PATH` and call `module._initPaths()` before requiring the target file.

## Status checkpoint (Updated 2025-10-09)

- **Phases 1‚Äì2:** Done (lint/format/spellcheck, utils tests).
- **Phase 3:** Router-level GET coverage removed as low value; no router mapping tests remain.
- **Phase 4:** Core `executeQuery` coverage trimmed to critical paths (NOTIFICATION parsing, MANAGE_CLASSES, DELAYED timers).
- **Phase 5:** Added unit coverage for config backup rotation, error paths (write failure, missing slots), and `UNDO_CONFIG` restore handling (match, missing, load error).
- **Phase 6:** Added contract-shape tests for `/api/module/installed`, `/api/config`, and `/api/translations` responses.
- **Next:** Monitoring only; roadmap phases closed unless new requirements surface.

## Test Roadmap (Phases)

The project follows a **lean, pragmatic** test roadmap. We focus on **critical logic** and **data integrity**, avoiding overkill for trivial forwarding or rarely-used flows.

### Phase 1 ‚Äî Base quality gates ‚úÖ Done

- Lint, formatter (`prettier`/`eslint`), spellcheck (`cspell`) configured and passing.
- CI/Badges added to README.

### Phase 2 ‚Äî Test runner & pure utilities ‚úÖ Done

- Node's built-in test runner configured.
- Unit tests for pure functions: `utils` (`capitalizeFirst`, `formatName`, `includes`) and `configUtils` (`cleanConfig` with edge cases: nulls, unknown modules, deep equality).
- Coverage baseline established (c8 thresholds: statements 5%, lines 5%, functions 4%, branches 5%).

### Phase 3 ‚Äî Router GET coverage ‚úÖ Done (leaned out)

- Initial router-level GET mapping tests were added but later removed (October 2025) after deciding they added little value beyond manual verification.
- ‚úÖ No router mapping tests remain; focus is on higher-value logic.

### Phase 4 ‚Äî Core action logic (critical paths only) ‚úÖ Done

- ‚úÖ NOTIFICATION JSON parsing (undefined payload, valid JSON string, raw string, invalid JSON ‚Üí error).
- ‚úÖ MANAGE_CLASSES (string key, array of keys ‚Üí correct HIDE/SHOW/TOGGLE dispatch).
- ‚úÖ DELAYED timer behavior (start, reset on same `did`, abort).
- ‚ùå Removed: HIDE/SHOW/TOGGLE, BRIGHTNESS/TEMP, SHOW_ALERT/HIDE_ALERT/REFRESH, USER_PRESENCE (all trivial forwarding).

### Phase 5 ‚Äî Persistence & backup rotation ‚úÖ Done

- ‚úÖ `answerPost` backup rotation: picks oldest slot, writes new config, handles fs errors.
- ‚úÖ Missing backup slots handled gracefully.
- ‚úÖ Write error propagates meaningful response.
- ‚úÖ `UNDO_CONFIG` restore flow: restores matched backup, falls back to saves when timestamp missing, surfaces load errors.
- üî≤ Additional edge cases (e.g., read stream errors) as needed (optional).

### Phase 6 ‚Äî Minimal contract checks (final polish) ‚úÖ Done

- **Goal:** Catch breaking API changes early.
- **Scope:** Validate **shape only** (not content) for 2‚Äì3 core GET endpoints against `docs/swagger.json`:
  - `/module/installed` ‚Üí array of objects with `name`/`longname`.
  - `/config` ‚Üí object (exact keys not critical, just structure).
  - Optional: `/translations` ‚Üí object with locale keys.
- **Implementation:** Lightweight JSON schema check or manual shape assertion; no heavy validator lib.
- **Status:** Tests live in `tests/unit/answerGet.contract.test.js` (module metadata filter, config merge shape, translation dictionary).
- **Coverage impact:** Minimal (contract tests don't add statement coverage, just regression safety).

### Phase 7+ ‚Äî Done ‚úÖ

- **No further phases planned.**
- Install/update flows, system commands, frontend DOM, E2E ‚Üí **out of scope** (too complex, low ROI for a MagicMirror module).
- Mutation testing ‚Üí **deferred indefinitely** (overkill for this project size).

## Cleanup summary (2025-10-09)

- Removed router-level GET tests (`tests/unit/api.getRoutes.mapping.test.js`).
- Trimmed `executeQuery.core.test.js` to only NOTIFICATION / MANAGE_CLASSES / DELAYED coverage.
- Lowered c8 coverage thresholds to a realistic baseline (statements 5%, lines 5%, functions 4%, branches 5%).

---

## Coverage Philosophy

- **Target:** ~30‚Äì35% statements after Phase 5 (backup rotation).
- **Not a goal:** High coverage for its own sake. Focus on **critical paths** and **data integrity**.
- **Strategy:** Raise thresholds modestly after each phase (if tests are stable), but keep them **achievable and meaningful**.

---

## Contributing Tests

When adding tests:

- **Ask:** Does this logic have edge cases or side effects? If no ‚Üí skip the test.
- **Patterns:**
  - Router handlers: Bind to fake context; avoid spinning up Express.
  - Timers: Use fake timers (manual or `node:test` mocks when available); restore originals after.
  - Filesystem: Mock `fs.promises` methods; no actual reads/writes.
- **Keep PRs small:** 1‚Äì2 test files per PR; clear titles (e.g., "test(backup): add rotation and undo cases").

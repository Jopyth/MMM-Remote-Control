# Magic Mirror Module: Remote Control w/ RESTful API

This module for the [Magic Mirror²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) allows you to quickly shutdown your mirror through a web browser.
The website should work fine on any device (desktop, smart phone, tablet, ...).
Since we all want our [SD cards to live a long and prosper life](http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/383) we properly shut down before pulling the power plug everytime, am I right?
Additionally you can hide and show modules on your mirror and do other cool stuff.

**New in Version 2.0.0:** The module now includes a more RESTful API for controlling all aspects of your mirror from other network-enabled devices and controllers--anything that can open a URL. See the [API README](API/README.md) for more info!

## Installation

### Quick install

If you followed the default installation instructions for the [Magic Mirror²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) project, you should be able to use the automatic installer.
The following command will download the installer and execute it:
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jopyth/MMM-Remote-Control/master/installer.sh)"
```

### Manual install

- (1) Clone this repository in your `modules` folder, and install dependencies:
```bash
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules # adapt directory if you are using a different one
git clone https://github.com/Jopyth/MMM-Remote-Control.git
cd MMM-Remote-Control
npm install
```

- (2) Add the module to your `config/config.js` file, if you add a `position`, it will display the URL to the remote on the mirror.
```js
{
    module: 'MMM-Remote-Control'
    // uncomment the following line to show the URL of the remote control on the mirror
    // , position: 'bottom_left'
    // you can hide this module afterwards from the remote control itself
    config: {
        customCommand: {},  // Optional, See "Using Custom Commands" below
        customMenu: "custom_menu.json", // Optional, See "Custom Menu Items" below
        showModuleApiMenu: true, // Optional, Enable the Module Controls menu
        apiKey: "",         // Optional, See API/README.md for details
    }
},
```

- (3) For security reasons, the MagicMirror (and therefore the Remote Control) is *not* reachable externally.
To change this, configure `address`, and `ipWhitelist` in your `config.js` (see [these lines in the sample config](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/blob/master/config/config.js.sample#L12-L22)).
For example change `address` to `0.0.0.0` and add two allowed devices with IP-Adresses `192.168.0.42` and `192.168.0.50`:
```
    address : '0.0.0.0',
    port: 8080,
    ipWhitelist: ["127.0.0.1", "::ffff:127.0.0.1", "::1", "::ffff:192.168.0.42", "::ffff:192.168.0.50"],"
```
You can also add multiple devices in an IP range (e.g. all devices with `192.168.0.X`):
```
    ipWhitelist: ["127.0.0.1", "::ffff:127.0.0.1", "::1", "::ffff:192.168.0.1/120", "192.168.0.1/24"],
```

- (4) Restart your Magic Mirror² (i.e. `pm2 restart MagicMirror`).

- (5) Access the remote interface on [http://192.168.xxx.xxx:8080/remote.html](http://192.168.xxx.xxx:8080/remote.html) (replace with IP address of your RaspberryPi).

Note: If your user does not have `sudo` rights, the shutdown does not work (it *should* work for everyone who did not change anything on this matter).

### Update

Update this module by navigating into its folder on the command line and using `git pull`:

```bash
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules/MMM-Remote-Control # adapt directory if you are using a different one
git pull
npm install # install (new) dependencies
```

Alternatively you can run the `installer.sh` script again:
```bash
~/MagicMirror/modules/MMM-Remote-Control/installer.sh
```

### Select version manually

You can check out specific versions in the following way.
First look at which versions are available:
```bash
cd MagicMirror/modules/MMM-Remote-Control # or wherever you installed the Mirror and the module
git fetch # fetch all tags
git tags # display them
```

The output should look similar to this:
```
v1.0.0
v1.1.0
v1.1.1
v1.1.2
```
Then you can checkout that version with, for example `git checkout v1.0.0`, or use `git checkout master` to checkout the most recent version.

## Known limitations

Whenever you change the order of modules in `config.js` or add/remove modules, the indices of the modules change.
Therefore the hidden/shown status of modules might not be correctly applied.
If this happens, simply reconfigure and save it again.

## Call methods from other modules

You can call any of the methods provided in the UI directly through a GET request, or a module notification.
For example you can use [MMM-ModuleScheduler](https://forum.magicmirror.builders/topic/691/mmm-modulescheduler) to automatically shutdown your RasberryPi at a certain time, or integrate it with home automation systems. Or use  [MMM-Navigate](https://github.com/Ax-LED/MMM-Navigate) to allow direct actions from your Mirror by using a rotating button. 

### Examples

- Example for a REST API GET request to trigger a RaspberryPi restart:
```
http://192.168.xxx.xxx:8080/api/restart
```

- Example to trigger a RaspberryPi restart in your module:
```
this.sendNotification('REMOTE_ACTION', {action: 'RESTART'});
```

See some specific examples for controlling your mirror from other modules and add your own examples [in the Wiki page here](https://github.com/shbatm/MMM-Remote-Control/wiki/Examples-for-Controlling-from-Another-Module)

| DEVTOOLS | Open the DevTools console window. |

#### Module Control:

| Action | Description |
| :-: | ------------- |
| HIDE | Hide a module, with the name (or identifier--see `MODULE_DATA` action) specified by `module` in the payload. You can also send `module: "all"` to hide all modules. |
| SHOW | Show a module (see above for how to specify which one). |
| TOGGLE | Toggle a module's visiblity (see above for how to specify which one). |
| FORCE | Force a module to show (see above for how to specify which one). |
| MODULE_DATA | Returns a JSON format of the data displayed in the UI, including all valid identifiers for the `HIDE` and `SHOW` action. |

#### Alerts and Notifications:

| Action | Description |
| :-: | ------------- |
| SHOW_ALERT | Show Default Alert/Notification |
| HIDE_ALERT | Hide Default Alert/Notification |
| USER_PRESENCE | Will send a notification "USER_PRESENCE" = true or false (according to "value" to all other modules. See examples above|
| NOTIFICATION | To send a notification to all modules, see the example in the [API README](API/README.md) |
| DELAYED | Send any of the above nested inside a "DELAYED" call to delay the action. Default is 10s. See Delayed Actions below. |

### Format of module data response

The response will be in the JSON format, here is an example:

```json
{
"moduleData":[
    {"hidden":false,"name":"alert","identifier":"module_0_alert"},
    {"hidden":true,"name":"clock","identifier":"module_1_clock","position":"bottom_right"},
    {"hidden":false,"name":"currentweather","identifier":"module_2_currentweather","position":"top_right"}
],
"brightness":40,
"settingsVersion":1
}
```

### Delayed Actions

You can delay an action by sending the notification nested inside of a `"DELAYED"` notification. Below is an example of turning off the monitor in 60s.

```js
this.sendSocketNotification("REMOTE_ACTION",
    {
        action: "DELAYED",
        did: "SOME_UNIQUE_ID", // Optional; Some string, in case you want to cancel later.
        timeout: 60,  // Optional; Default 10s
        abort: false, // Optional; send true to cancel an existing timer
        query: {
            action: "MONITOROFF"
        }
    });
```

Can also be used with the [API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/6167403/Rzfni66c) by adding `/delay?timeout=10s&did=something` to some routes.

### Using Custom Commands

Depending on your installation, some `shell` commands used by this module are not appropriate and can be overwritten by something that will work for you. To overwrite the commands, add a `customCommand` object to your config section.  The following commands are supported:

```js
    customCommand: {
        monitorOnCommand: 'shell command to turn on your monitor',
        monitorOffCommand: 'shell command to turn off your monitor',
        monitorStatusCommand: 'shell command to return status of monitor, must return either "HDMI" or "true" if screen is on; or "TV is Off" or "false" if it is off to be recognized'
    }
```

### Custom Menu Items

You can create your own customized menu items by providing creating a JSON file for the menu and providing a `customMenu: "custom_menu.json"` directive in your config. The file may be called whatever you want, but the name must be provided in the `config` section, and it must be stored in the Mirror's `config/` directory (same place as your `config.js` file).

An example menu is provided in this module's folder, titled `custom_menu.example.json`. You can copy this to the `/config` folder and modify as you need.

#### Key Components:

| Name | Description |
| :-: | - |
| `id` | The HTML id prefix to use for the menu item.
| `type` | The item type, either `'menu'` or `'item'`. `'menu'` is used to indicate the item is a sub-menu and has an ``items`` array. `'item'` is used for single menu items and will send a socket "REMOTE_ACTION" notification back to the server.  This requires `action:` and `content:` parameters before it can do anything.
| `text` | The text to display.  You can use the translate string `'%%TRANSLATE:YOUR_KEY_HERE%%'`, but remember to also update the appropriate file in `/translations`.
| `icon` | The [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/) icon to use (without the leading `-fa`)
| `items` | An array of sub-menu items to use with `"type":"menu"`. Should be the same format as the top level menu (i.e. the menu structure is recursive).
| `action` | The `REMOTE_ACTION` notification action name, usually `NOTIFICATION`. Required for `"type":"item"` items to be able to do anything.
| `content` | The `REMOTE_ACTION` action payload to send.  Usually for `"NOTIFICATION"`, this is of the form `{ "notification": "NOTIFICATION_TO_SEND", "payload": "PAYLOAD_TO_SEND"}`

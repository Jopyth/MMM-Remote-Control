# Magic Mirror Module: Remote Control

This module for the [Magic Mirror²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) allows you to quickly shutdown your mirror through a web browser.
The website should work fine on any device (desktop, smart phone, tablet, ...).
Since we all want our [SD cards to live a long and prosper life](http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/383) we properly shut down before pulling the power plug everytime, am I right?
Additionally you can hide and show modules on your mirror and do other cool stuff.

## Installation

### Quick install

If you followed the default installation instructions for the [Magic Mirror²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) project, you should be able to use the automatic installer.
The following command will download the installer and execute it:
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jopyth/MMM-Remote-Control/master/installer.sh)"
```

### Manual install

- (1) Clone this repository in your `modules` folder, and install dependencies:
```bash
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules # adapt directory if you are using a different one
git clone https://github.com/Jopyth/MMM-Remote-Control.git
cd MMM-Remote-Control
npm install
```

- (2) Add the module to your `config/config.js` file, if you add a `position`, it will display the URL to the remote on the mirror.
```js
{
    module: 'MMM-Remote-Control'
    // uncomment the following line to show the URL of the remote control on the mirror
    // , position: 'bottom_left'
    // you can hide this module afterwards from the remote control itself
},
```

- (3) Add the IP addresses of devices you want to use to access the Remote Control to the `ipWhiteList` in your `config.js`.

- (4) Restart your Magic Mirror² (i.e. `pm2 restart mm`).

- (5) Access the remote interface on [http://192.168.xxx.xxx:8080/remote.html](http://192.168.xxx.xxx:8080/remote.html) (replace with IP address of your RaspberryPi).

Note: If your user does not have `sudo` rights, the shutdown does not work (it *should* work for everyone who did not change anything on this matter).

### Update

Update this module by navigating into its folder on the command line and using `git pull`:

```bash
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules/MMM-Remote-Control # adapt directory if you are using a different one
git pull
npm install # install (new) dependencies
```

Alternatively you can run the `installer.sh` script again:
```bash
~/MagicMirror/modules/MMM-Remote-Control/installer.sh
```

### Select version manually

You can check out specific versions in the following way.
First look at which versions are available:
```bash
cd MagicMirror/modules/MMM-Remote-Control # or wherever you installed the Mirror and the module
git fetch # fetch all tags
git tags # display them
```

The output should look similar to this:
```
v1.0.0
v1.1.0
v1.1.1
v1.1.2
```
Then you can checkout that version with, for example `git checkout v1.0.0`, or use `git checkout master` to checkout the most recent version.

## Known limitations

Whenever you change the order of modules in `config.js` or add/remove modules, the indices of the modules change.
Therefore the hidden/shown status of modules might not be correctly applied.
If this happens, simply reconfigure and save it again.

## Call methods from other modules

You can call any of the methods provided in the UI directly through a GET request, or a module notification.
For example you can use [MMM-ModuleScheduler](https://forum.magicmirror.builders/topic/691/mmm-modulescheduler) to automatically shutdown your RasberryPi at a certain time, or integrate it with home automation systems.

### Examples

- Example for a GET request to trigger a RaspberryPi restart:
```
http://192.168.xxx.xxx:8080/remote?action=RESTART
```

- Example for a notification schedule for [MMM-ModuleScheduler](https://forum.magicmirror.builders/topic/691/mmm-modulescheduler) to automatically switch your monitor on and off with :
```javascript
notification_schedule: [
    {notification: 'REMOTE_ACTION', schedule: '30 9 * * *', payload: {action: 'MONITOROFF'}},
    {notification: 'REMOTE_ACTION', schedule: '30 18 * * *', payload: {action: 'MONITORON'}}
]
```

- Example to trigger a RaspberryPi restart in your module:
```
this.sendNotification('REMOTE_ACTION', {action: 'RESTART'});
```

### List of actions

| action | description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| SHUTDOWN | Shutdown your RaspberryPi |
| REBOOT | Restart your RaspberryPi |
| RESTART | Restart your MagicMirror |
| MONITORON | Switch your display on |
| MONITOROFF | Switch your display off |
| SAVE | Save the current configuration (show and hide status of modules, and brightness), will be applied after the mirror starts |
| BRIGHTNESS | Change mirror brightness, with the new value specified by `value`. `100` equals the default, possible range is between `10` and `200`. |
| HIDE | Hide a module, with the identifier specified by `module` (see `MODULE_DATA` action). |
| SHOW | Show a module, with the identifier specified by `module` (see `MODULE_DATA` action). |
| MODULE_DATA | Returns a JSON format of the data displayed in the UI, including all valid identifiers for the `HIDE` and `SHOW` action. |
| REFRESH | Refresh mirror page |
| SHOW_ALERT | Show Default Alert/Notification |
| HIDE_ALERT | Hide Default Alert/Notification |
| UPDATE | Update MagicMirror and any of it's modules |
| NOTIFICATION | Send a notification to all modules (see [Notification Request](#notification-request)). |
| GLANCE_ON | Activate a glance for a module or alias with the identifier specified by `module` and an optional `time` (requires [MMM-Glance](https://github.com/eouia/MMM-Glance))|
| GLANCE_OFF | Deactivate all glances and shows the default screen (requires [MMM-Glance](https://github.com/eouia/MMM-Glance))|

### Format of module data response

The response will be in the JSON format, here is an example:

```json
{
"moduleData":[
    {"hidden":false,"name":"alert","identifier":"module_0_alert"},
    {"hidden":true,"name":"clock","identifier":"module_1_clock","position":"bottom_right"},
    {"hidden":false,"name":"currentweather","identifier":"module_2_currentweather","position":"top_right"}
],
"brightness":40,
"settingsVersion":1
}
```

### Notification Request

To send a notification to all modules, send the following GET-parameters.

| key | value |
| --- | ----- |
| action | `NOTIFICATION`<br>**Required** |
| notification | The notification to send, e.g. `ARTICLE_MORE_DETAILS`, `SHOW_ALERT` or `HIDE_ALERT`.<br>**Required** |
| payload | A stringified JSON object with the payload for the notification.<br>**Optional** if absent, an empty payload (`{}`) is assumed. |

Examples:

```
?action=NOTIFICATION&notification=ARTICLE_MORE_DETAILS

?action=NOTIFICATION&notification=SHOW_ALERT&payload={%22title%22:%22Alert%22,%22message%22:%22This%20is%an%20alert.%22}
(Payload is URL-encoded form of {"title":"Alert","message":"This is an alert."})

?action=NOTIFICATION&notification=HIDE_ALERT
```
